# Dockerfile

# Step 1: Start with an official, lightweight Python base image.
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Step 2: Set the working directory inside the container.
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy the requirements file first and install dependencies.
# This is a best practice for layer caching. If the requirements don't change,
# Docker won't need to reinstall them every time you change your code.
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Step 4: Copy the rest of the application code into the working directory.
COPY . .

# Step 5: Inform Docker that the container will listen on port 5000 at runtime.
EXPOSE 5000

# Step 6: Define the command to run when the container starts.
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
